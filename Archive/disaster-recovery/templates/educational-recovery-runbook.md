## üè´ EDUCATIONAL SERVICE RECOVERY PROCEDURES

### Scenario A: Backend Service Down (RTO: 5 minutes)

**Symptoms:**
- Students cannot access transcription services
- API health checks failing: `curl https://api.neurobridge.edu/health`
- Prometheus alert: `EducationalBackendDown`

**Immediate Actions:**
```bash
# 1. Check pod status
kubectl get pods -n neurobridge-edu -l component=backend

# 2. Scale up pods immediately
kubectl scale deployment neurobridge-backend -n neurobridge-edu --replicas=5

# 3. Check recent logs
kubectl logs -n neurobridge-edu deployment/neurobridge-backend --tail=100

# 4. Restart if needed
kubectl rollout restart deployment/neurobridge-backend -n neurobridge-edu

# 5. Monitor recovery
kubectl rollout status deployment/neurobridge-backend -n neurobridge-edu
```

**Validation:**
```bash
# Test educational endpoints
curl https://api.neurobridge.edu/health
curl https://api.neurobridge.edu/api/transcription/config
```

### Scenario B: Database Issues (RTO: 30 minutes)

**Symptoms:**
- Database connection errors
- Student authentication failures
- API key retrieval failures

**Immediate Actions:**
```bash
# 1. Check database pod
kubectl get pods -n neurobridge-edu -l component=database

# 2. Check database connectivity
kubectl exec -n neurobridge-edu deployment/neurobridge-backend -- \
  pg_isready -h database -U neurobridge

# 3. Review database logs
kubectl logs -n neurobridge-edu deployment/database --tail=100

# 4. If corruption suspected, initiate recovery
./disaster-recovery/scripts/educational-db-restore.sh production latest
```

### Scenario C: Complete Infrastructure Failure (RTO: 60 minutes)

**Symptoms:**
- Multiple services down
- Kubernetes cluster unreachable
- DNS resolution failures

**Immediate Actions:**
```bash
# 1. Activate disaster recovery site
./disaster-recovery/scripts/educational-failover.sh activate

# 2. Check cluster status
kubectl cluster-info
kubectl get nodes

# 3. If cluster down, use backup cluster
export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/backup-cluster-config
kubectl apply -k kubernetes/overlays/production/
```
