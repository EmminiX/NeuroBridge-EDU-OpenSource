## Educational Disaster Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Morning Lecture Rush Failure (8-10 AM Peak)
**Probability:** Medium  
**Educational Impact:** HIGH - Multiple concurrent lectures affected

**Detection:**
- Prometheus alerts: `EducationalBackendDown` or `MorningLectureRush`
- Student reports via educational helpdesk
- Automated health check failures

**Response:**
1. **Immediate (0-2 minutes):**
   - Activate educational incident commander
   - Scale backend pods: `kubectl scale deployment neurobridge-backend --replicas=10`
   - Notify educational IT operations team

2. **Short-term (2-15 minutes):**
   - Switch to GPU-enabled nodes if available
   - Activate backup educational cluster
   - Implement API rate limiting bypass for educational institutions

3. **Recovery Validation:**
   - Test with sample transcription request
   - Monitor educational usage metrics
   - Confirm with affected educational institutions

### Scenario 2: Educational Database Corruption
**Probability:** Low  
**Educational Impact:** CRITICAL - All historical educational data at risk

**Detection:**
- Database connection failures
- Data integrity check failures
- Student unable to access historical transcriptions

**Response:**
1. **Immediate (0-5 minutes):**
   - Stop all write operations to database
   - Activate database backup restoration procedure
   - Switch to read-only mode for educational queries

2. **Database Recovery (5-30 minutes):**
   ```bash
   # Educational database recovery procedure
   ./disaster-recovery/scripts/educational-db-restore.sh production latest
   ```

3. **Data Validation:**
   - Verify educational record integrity
   - Test student authentication flows
   - Validate API key decryption

### Scenario 3: Complete Educational Infrastructure Failure
**Probability:** Very Low  
**Educational Impact:** CRITICAL - All educational institutions affected

**Detection:**
- Multiple Kubernetes nodes down
- Network connectivity loss
- External monitoring alerts

**Response:**
1. **Immediate (0-10 minutes):**
   - Activate educational disaster recovery site
   - Execute full infrastructure failover
   - Notify all educational stakeholders

2. **Infrastructure Recovery (10-60 minutes):**
   ```bash
   # Educational disaster recovery activation
   ./disaster-recovery/scripts/educational-failover.sh activate
   ```

3. **Educational Service Restoration:**
   - DNS failover to backup educational endpoints
   - SSL certificate validation
   - Educational user acceptance testing

## Educational Backup Strategy

### Primary Backup Locations
1. **Educational Primary:** AWS S3 (us-east-1) - Educational compliance region
2. **Educational DR:** AWS S3 (us-west-2) - Geographic diversity
3. **Local Educational:** On-premise NAS - Immediate recovery capability

### Educational Backup Verification

# Daily educational backup verification
0 6 * * * /opt/neurobridge/backup/verify-educational-backups.sh

# Weekly educational backup restoration test
0 2 * * 0 /opt/neurobridge/disaster-recovery/test-educational-recovery.sh
```

## Educational Communication Plan

## Educational Recovery Procedures

### Kubernetes Educational Deployment Recovery
```yaml
# Educational priority pod scheduling
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
spec:
  priorityClassName: educational-critical
  nodeSelector:
    educational-priority: "true"
  affinity:

./scripts/validate-educational-backup.sh ${BACKUP_DATE}

# 2. Restore educational database
./scripts/restore-educational-database.sh ${BACKUP_FILE}

# 3. Verify educational data integrity  
./scripts/verify-educational-data.sh

# 4. Update educational application configuration
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/educational-recovery-config.yaml

# 5. Restart educational services with health checks
